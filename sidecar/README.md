Sidecar is SugarCRM's client-side MVC framework. It extends [Backbone.js][backbone] and forms the core of
both the SugarCRM web application and Sugar's mobile offerings.

## Getting Started

Sidecar requires [Node.js][nodejs] version 6.0.0 or higher to be installed.
**Make sure you also have the `npm` package.**

We also recommend using [Yarn][yarn].

If you use Homebrew, you can install Node.js and Yarn like this:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install node yarn
```

Now install the dependencies by running:

```bash
$ yarn
```
